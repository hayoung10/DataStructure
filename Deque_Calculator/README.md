Deque를 이용한 수식 계산기

- A **deque** class template using a **doubly-linked list**
- An arithmetric expression conversion & evaluation function using a deque
- In order for a deque to store data in a doubly-linked list, implement all the following list functions
> list_insert  
> list_head_insert  
> list_search  
> list_locate  
> list_remove  
> list_head_remove  
> list_copy

- Implement the following deque class member functions and operators
> copy constructor  
> destructor  
> = operator  
> push_front  
> push_back  
> pop_front  
> pop_back  
> front  
> back 
> empty  

- Implement an expression evaluator class
- Main program checks to see if all the deque functions work correctly and takes a valid infix expression from the standard input and then prints the input expression (in infix notation), its postfix expression, and the evaluation result using the evaluator member functions.
