Linked List을 이용한 Bag Class 및 추가 함수 구현

##### 추가 함수
- removeRepetitions()
  - removes all repetitions (if any) from the list in a bag
  - You can assume that items in the bag are compared for equality using ==.
- reverse()
  - reverses the order of the nodes so that the last node is first, the first node is last, and so on
  - Note that this function actually changes the head pointer if there are two or more items in the bag.
- sort()
  - actually changes the order of data items stored in the bag to ascending order
  - You can use any sorting algorithm you know, but do not use array to sort items.
- show_content()
  - prints its content on the standard output

###### Write a main program to check to see if all the functions, constructors, and operators (insert, erase_one, count, +, +=, -, -=, =, ==, copy constructor, removeRepetitions, reverse, sort) in the bag class work correctly.
